     6.1 When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If for some reason we are unable to confirm your booking, you will not be charged and we will request that such hold be released by your credit or debit card bank; until then, funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for other purposes. We bear no responsibility in the event your credit or debit card is not approved or charged. <br/><br/>
6.2 We use stringent safety measures for credit card payment processing. Fraudulent transactions, if any, are reported to airport security, airlines, and other federal and state law enforcement. <br/><br/>
6.3 You agree to be liable for any and all credit card payments made using THD.com. If a Supplier does not provide the service or ceases operations, your recourse is against the Supplier with whom services were not provided. Most credit card transactions over the phone to our Customer Service Department are recorded and are available as evidence in case of any dispute. When certain transactions are determined to be high risk by our systems, we will not process such transactions unless our credit card verification team has determined that it is safe to process them. In order to establish validity of such transactions, we may contact you or your bank.  <br/><br/>
6.4 Advertised airfares and hotel prices are inclusive of all taxes and fees. However, because a Supplier may separate taxes and fees, you may see charges on your credit card from both these Suppliers and us. Please contact us for additional information if you have questions.  <br/><br/>
      
<b>6.5 Credit Card Chargebacks</b>
    <p class="para-font" style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; ;font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; text-rendering: optimizespeed; text-transform: capitalize; line-height: 20px; margin: 0 20px;">
      
      6.5.1 You, the User, have the ability to dispute charges with credit card companies ("chargebacks"). If you have a question about a charge on your credit card statement, we encourage you to call THD prior to disputing a charge with your credit card company to discuss any questions or concerns about our charges with us. THD will work with you in resolving your concerns. THD retains the right to dispute any chargeback that it believes is improper, as described more fully below. THD also retains the right to cancel any travel reservation in the event of a chargeback related to that reservation.<br/><br/>
      6.5.2 By using our service to make a reservation, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation policy of the Supplier with which the reservation involves. It is your responsibility to review the Supplier’s cancellation policy prior to using our services to place a reservation with them. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. THD deems the following chargeback scenarios as improper and retains the right to investigate and rebut any such chargeback claims and to recover costs of such chargeback claims from You, the User.<br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Chargebacks resulting from any used reservations or non-cancellable reservations in the event that THD or the Supplier cannot provide a refund, whether or not the reservation is used.
</li>
         <li>Chargebacks resulting from charges authorized by family, friends, associates or other third parties with direct access to You, the User’s, credit card.

</li>
         <li>Chargebacks arising from the failure of the Supplier’s failure to deliver a product or service in a manner that’s consistent with the Supplier and/or service provider’s product description.

</li>
         <li>Chargebacks resulting from force majeure or other circumstances that are beyond the control of THD.com or its subsidiaries.

If you make a purchase from us using a non-USD-denominated credit or debit card, please be aware that, due to the constant fluctuation in exchange rates, the charge to your card or the estimated charge amount we provide you, may differ based on the exchange rate at the time you make your reservation versus the rate at the time the charge is reflected on your credit card statement. Also, in the event that we must credit your account, we will refund the exact USD amount initially charged and will not be responsible for any fluctuations in exchange rates which may cause differences in your billing statement.

If your domestic flight or your US-originating foreign flight on a US airline is delayed for any reason, the airlines are not required by law to compensate you or pay for your enroute expenses, such as meals, hotels, taxes and phone calls. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRAVEL INSURANCE FOR ALL YOUR TRAVEL PLANS.

10.2 If you have any questions or concerns about your itinerary, or if your ticket is not honored for any reason, you must contact us immediately at info@TripHelpDesk.com.

If the Supplier cancels or rescheduled for any reason, we may extend a credit toward a future trip to the same geographical region at our sole discretion. The foregoing is our sole responsibility in connection with the Supplier’s cancellation or rescheduling of any trip. If you miss your flight, missed flights are not refundable, and changes or replacement flights will be at the discretion of the airline. In some cases, we may be able to help you, but in most cases you will not be provided with a replacement flight unless the airline itself allows it.  If all or any portion of an itinerary is not used for any reason, payment is forfeited.

It is the passenger's responsibility to have all necessary travel documents in possession at check-in. Please note, Airline tickets, hotels and car rentals are subject to the published conditions of carriage and rules, including but not limited to cancellation policies, of the applicable airline, hotel or car rental service. Airlines retain the right to adjust flight times and schedules at any time - schedule changes can result in an itinerary that falls outside of contractual agreements. Airlines may also in their discretion change or cancel flights or itineraries. Please review the applicable Supplier’s Terms of Use. THD will make no refund in the event of any delay, cancellation, overbooking, strike, force majeure or other causes beyond our direct control, and THD has no responsibility for any additional expenses, omissions, delays, re-routing or acts of any government or authority.   <br/><br/>
12.3 Orders which are not canceled within 24 hours will not be refundable. If an order has not been canceled within 24 hours, you may be eligible for a Travel Credit. This Travel Credit and any transportation covered by it are subject to the applicable tariffs, conditions of carriage, and rules and regulations of the Airlines effective at the time of ticket issuance.
